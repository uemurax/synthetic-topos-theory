  @paragraph{
    Let @(math T) be a type theory.
    We want to turn the type theory of spaces in @(math T)
    into a @emph{directed type theory}.
    However, what we actually get is
    a @emph{quasi-}directed type theory.
    All types have hom types,
    but hom types are not necessarily well-behaved.
    For example, composition is not always defined.
  }
  @paragraph{
    More rules will be coming
    so that hom types of toposes
    are well-behaved.
