    By topos we mean @(math @tex:infty)-topos.
  }
  @paragraph{
    In this under-construction document,
    we present some ideas of
    @emph{synthetic topos theory}.
  }
  @paragraph{
    Standard textbooks
    (@ref["Mac-Lane--Moerdijk--1992-0000"],
     @ref["Johnstone--2002-0000"],
     @ref["Johnstone--2002-0001"],
     and @ref["Lurie--2009-0000"] for example)
    begin by defining toposes
    as categories having certain structures.
    This is an analytic approach
    to topos theory.
  }
  @paragraph{
    In contrast,
    synthetic topos theory
    begins by introducing axioms
    that directly capture the
    core aspects of topos theory.
    To do this,
    we use the @emph{type theory of toposes}.
    This should not be confused with
    the internal language of a topos.
    In the internal language of a topos,
    types are sheaves on the topos.
    In the type theory of toposes,
    types are toposes.
    So toposes are now a primitive concept
    in this type theory,
    and we can develop topos theory
    without knowing what toposes really are.
  }
  @paragraph{
    Because every topos has
    its own internal language,
    the type theory of toposes
    should be integrated with
    the internal languages of toposes.
    Having in mind the fact that
    every topos classifies
    models of a @emph{geometric theory},
    we think of the type theory of toposes
    as a @emph{logical framework} for geometric theories.
    Every type (topos) in the type theory of toposes
    is read as a geometric theory,
    and we introduce the @emph{type theory of sheaves} on the topos
    which is a type theory
    equipped with a @emph{generic model}
    of the geometric theory.
    In this way,
    we have access to the internal languages
    of all toposes within a single system.
