  @paragraph{
    In @ref["0000"],
    we review the @math{2}-category of toposes.
    This section is not needed for the rest
    but gives some intuitions
    for the design of axioms
    for synthetic topos theory.
  }
  @paragraph{
    @ref["001T"] is the core of the document.
    We introduce the @emph{topical type theory}
    within which
    topos theory will be developed synthetically.
  }
  @paragraph{
    In @ref["0039"],
    we develop basic topo theory
    in the topical type theory.
  }
  @paragraph{
    In @ref["003V"], @ref["004M"], and @ref["0042"],
    we study some concrete examples of toposes
    in the topical type theory.
